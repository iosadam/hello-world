# hello-world
This is my first attempt at Github.  

I am beginning the journey into ios development.  So far I have learned a lot, but it is very difficult and confusing to keep track of everything that needs to be done correctly.  I hope I continue to work towards understanding all of the aspects of app development.  It is **hard**, but I hope it will be worth it.  This is just one stage of the *journey*.  Let's see where it goes....
